Software Design Review One Notes:

General Notes:
	-> scrolling play area


AI Notes:
	-> Avoid places enemies commonly die
	-> movement behavior exchange
		-> real time interaction
	-> enemies reproduce
		-> stronger enemies have a higher reproduction speed
			-> controlled by damage dealt
	-> some enemies can heal others
		-> maybe stronger enemies consume others to heal

Character Notes:
	-> choose gun/upgrade
		-> make it so that the gun does not lead to boring evolution
